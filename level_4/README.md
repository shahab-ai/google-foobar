LEVEL 4
=======

Excellent! You’ve destroyed commander lambda’s doomsday device and saved Bunny Planet! But there’s one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important part of her space station. And when you blew it up. You triggered a chain reaction that’s tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the imprisoned bunnies and escape before the entire thing explodes?

Six thousand, seven hundred and forty-one six thousand, seven hundred and forty-two, six thousand, seven hundred and forty-three… Good grief! Just how many bunnies has commander lambda captured?!

This was supposed to be an infiltration-and-rescue mission, not a repeat of the Great Cowland Station fiasco! You didn’t think rescuing bunnies would involve this much running.
